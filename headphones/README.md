 Headphones Website Project
This project is part of the ALX HTML & CSS Curriculum, designed to teach web development fundamentals through hands-on projects. The goal of this project is to replicate a beautifully designed headphones landing page using semantic HTML and modern CSS techniques.

📁 Project Structure
This project includes the following:

HTML markup that is clean, accessible, and semantically structured.
CSS using advanced selectors, flexbox, responsive layouts, and hover/active states.
Responsive Design that adapts to both desktop and mobile views.
Assets such as images, fonts, and icons linked or imported as per the Figma design.
🎨 Figma Design
To follow along with the original design:

Create a Figma account (if you haven’t already).
Open the Headphones Figma file (Replace with actual link).
Click "Duplicate to your Drafts" to get full access to measurements, fonts, colors, and layout specifications.
